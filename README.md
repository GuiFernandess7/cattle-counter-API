# Cattle Counting API

### Overview

The Cattle Counter API is a tool designed to automate the counting of cattle in images using computer vision techniques. Leveraging OpenCV for image processing and masking, this API provides detection and counting of cattle in images. The project is ideal for agricultural technology applications where monitoring livestock numbers is crucial for farm management and analytics.

The Cattle Counter API is currently in development and, at this stage, uses only basic image masking techniques with the OpenCV library for cattle detection and counting. The system is in an early phase, and the techniques employed are limited to color-based segmentation and contour detection.
